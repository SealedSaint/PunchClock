# PunchClock

###Why PunchClock?###

PunchClock was born out of my frustration with the difficulties of tracking my time to different clients throughout the day. I built PunchClock to make it easy to switch your time to various projects. At the end of the day your totals per project are already displayed.

###Built with Electron###

This version of PunchClock is built with [Electron](https://electron.atom.io/) and has desktop builds for Mac, Windows, and Linux.
